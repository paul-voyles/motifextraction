The motifextraction code (NOT the code in this directory, but rather located here: https://github.com/paul-voyles/motifextraction/tree/master/packages/motifextraction) falls under a different license than the ppm3d code in this directory.

The ppm3d code in this directory uses the ppm3d code written by Arash Dehghan Banadaki and Srikanth Patala. The license for that code can be found in its repository: https://github.com/spatala/ppm3d
The file `ppm3d.py` in this directory uses code was also largely written by Arash Dehghan Banadaki and Srikanth Patala and falls under the same license.
